//! The ZigBee Device Profile (2.4)
//!
//! The ZigBee Device Profile operates like any ZigBee profile by defining clusters.
//! Unlike application specific profiles, the clusters within the ZigBee Device Profile define capabilities supported in all ZigBee devices.
//! 
//! The Device Profile supports four key inter-device communication functions within the ZigBee protocol.
//! These functions are explained in the following sections: 
//! * Device and Service Discovery Overview 
//! * End Device Bind Overview 
//! * Bind and Unbind Overview 
//! * Binding Table Management Overview 
//! * Network Management Overview
